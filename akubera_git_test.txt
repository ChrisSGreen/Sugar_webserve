To use the git repo:
    git clone https://<GIT_USERNAME>@github.com/jmertic/KSU_Capstone_Spring_2011_Python.git <PRIVATE_DIRECTORY>

go into the directory and make whatever changes you need to. I'm going to add this file.

    git add akubera_git_test.txt

you can use `git status` to see changes made

I think I had to re-add the file after writing the previous line and this line. :-( not sure why we have to re-add every file after we change it.

I was wrong to push it this early, we need to update our LOCAL repository version first by using the commit command

   git commit

It will bring up vi and ask for a message. I don't like fancy text editors...

NOW we commit this to the main repository by pushing

    git push

alright, I tried `git commit -a` to auto add the changed files (this file) and it brought me to vi, but then said this:

> git commit -a
error: There was a problem with the editor 'vi'.
Please supply the message using either -m or -F option.

so we're submitting it now using git commit -am 'message'
