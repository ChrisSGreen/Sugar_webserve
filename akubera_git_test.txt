To use the git repo:
    git clone https://<GIT_USERNAME>@github.com/jmertic/KSU_Capstone_Spring_2011_Python.git <PRIVATE_DIRECTORY>

go into the directory and make whatever changes you need to. I'm going to add this file.

    git add akubera_git_test.txt

you can use `git status` to see changes made

I think I had to re-add the file after writing the previous line and this line. :-( not sure why we have to re-add every file after we change it.

Committing this file using 'push'

    git push
